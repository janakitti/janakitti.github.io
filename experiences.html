          I, along with my partner, competed in the Entrepreneurship Start-up Business Plan category where we developed our own start-up business and prepared an 11-page report to pitch to a panel of judges. In 2018, we created Spark, a parking lot management system designed to reduce the amount of traffic on the streets of major cities due to ineffective parking systems. We became Provincial Champions with our product and competed at the international level (ICDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2019, we created STRING, a visual-based productivity app that uses the visual analogy of strings and knots to improve productivity among students and employees. We also became Provincial Champions for this project.
