          <p>
          The Student Activity Council is dedicated to enriching the school climate through special events by the students FOR the students. Members of council facilitate other school events to ensure that they run smoothly and successfully.
          </p>
          <p>As Secretary, I established a new Google Calendar system for the council, developed a new structure for organizing digital documents, and in general understood what it meant to be a role model to younger students in the school.
          </p>
          <p>
          In the following year, I ran for Vice President. As Vice President, my lasting contribution to the Woodlands lie in the relationships I’ve built with others, whether it’d be executives of other clubs, teachers and office staff, or simply the rest of the school body. Running assemblies and elections, serving as an ambassador for open houses, facilitating supercouncil, or just greeting people in the halls, I believe that I have successfully grown into the role model I’ve always aspired to be the moment I first walked into this school. With regards to events, I am proud to have been able to be a part of the very team that planned and executed this year’s well-received Semi Formal and (for the first time in a long time) school Carnival.

          <p>
          Team 4308: ABSOLUTE ROBOTICS is an FRC robotics team based at the Woodlands School in Mississauaga, Ontario. Our team consists of over 80 members from grades 7-12 who are passionate about the STEM. Our team became divisional semi-finalists at the Detroit World Championship the past year!
          </p>
          <p>
          My experience in robotics has opened me to building strong and meaningful connections with teammates that are valuable in any field. Becoming a leader in the team also gave me an overarching view of all aspects of the development of our robot and build well-rounded skills that I could carry on beyond the competition.

          DECA is an international business competition that aims to prepare emerging leaders and entrepreneurs in marketing, finance, hospitality and management in high schools and colleges around the globe.

          I, along with my partner, competed in the Entrepreneurship Start-up Business Plan category where we developed our own start-up business and prepared an 11-page report to pitch to a panel of judges. In 2018, we created Spark, a parking lot management system designed to reduce the amount of traffic on the streets of major cities due to ineffective parking systems. We became Provincial Champions with our product and competed at the international level (ICDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2019, we created STRING, a visual-based productivity app that uses the visual analogy of strings and knots to improve productivity among students and employees. We also became Provincial Champions for this project.
