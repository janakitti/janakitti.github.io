        FedoraField is a 2D top-down action video game where you play as a character with a magical fedora that has the ability to control gravitational and electromagnetic fields. That's it. No guns, swords, or sheilds. The object of the game is to bring as many Blue Orbs (scattered across the level) to a central Beacon as possible while avoiding Pink Enemies and their bullets. Be careful though, Orbs will shatter if they touch anything (including you!). Now how can this be possible when all you've got is this fancy hat?

        </p>
        <b>Blue Gravity: </b> Activate this to accelerate Blue Orbs towards you.
        </p>
        </p>
        <b>Pinks Gravity: </b> Bring bullets shot by enemies towards you and into circular motion. This is your only way to fire back! Release your Pink Gravity to send bullets on a tangent and back to your enemy.
        </p>
        <b>Magnetic Field: </b> Attract metal blocks and walls in the environment to open up patheways or smash walls and enemies.
        </p>
        <b>Electric Field: </b> Induce a current in metal tunnels to activate engines and motors that can assist you in your battle.

        Tangible is a universal touch-screen accessory that can be installed on any monitor to provide touch-screen functionality via USB. This was a 1A team final project for my Software Engineering course in which we set out to develop of creative yet functional product that involved both hardware and software. Tangible consists of an array of ultrasonic sensors that snaps onto to the top of a monitor or laptop screen and plugs into the computer with minimal setup. The device works by firing the ultrasonic sensors down the face of the screen and measuring the distance to the nearest obstruction (i.e. a finger) and mapping the detected position onto a position on the screen. Tangible offers various touch modes including webpage scrolling, freestyle painting, button pressing, and many more. We developed a "TangibleOS" in Unity to showcase a variety of apps made specifically to demonstrate the different ouch capabilities of Tangible. These apps include a paint app, a virtual guitar, binary calculator, driving game, and a 2d platformer.

        WizardOfColours is a YouTube channel that showcases create and technical projects that were created using minimal technical resources. The channel was inspired by my dream of creating video games and animations despite not having the skills nor the software at the time to do so. The desire to create pushed me to discover...

        <b>Chromatic Squares: </b> A full-featured platformer game built entirely using Microsoft PowerPoint and over 440 slides. The game features 7-levels with on-screen controls, a gravity system, powerups, animations, level-save and logic, and a soundtrack. This project was accomplished by using a network of hyperlinks between all the slides for control logic and timed transitions for animations.

        <b>Paint Galaxy: </b> A cursor controlled video game where you move your cursor across an abstract land of moving figues, avoiding obstacles. The game features multiple levels and worlds and ends off with working boss. The boss stage includes an animated boss character witha health bar and the ability to fire bullets. The boss is attacked using mouse-over hyperlinks.

          Piing is an echolocation-inspired "VR" maze game where players where headphones, a Myo Arband, and hold a computer mouse in their hand. The objective was to navigate through a randomly generated grid maze by sending pings with their virtual sound gun towards the walls of the maze and waiting to hear its echo. The time delay between a ping and its echo would be proportional to the distance between the player and the wall they were facing. The play operates the controls all without any visual representation of the maze or their position in it.
